            <h3>Context</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>For the last SEP class I am taking in HighSchool, I created one last final freedom project using any tool and language I wanted even if we learned java the whole year. Out of all the things I could of made, I choose to make a game yet again but this time using goDot. I partnered with Shelly to create a 3D survival game in which the only goal was to gain as much points as possible by killing the mobs that spawn. Your only objective was to swing the sword and defeat the mobs one by one until you die. There is a scoreboard on top to keep track of your points and a deathscreen when you finally lost. Below is the challenges I encountered, takeaways and lastly what you been waiting for, a few links to our game</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Collaborating on this project on goDot and GitHub was the worst thing that happened during this project. It was so bad that I started hating working with others due to it. Since GoDot was not designed for a two-person team, it was extremely hard to figure out how exactly to push and pull each other's work. Even with the help of GitHub, whenever we pulled or pushed, the other person did not get the code we coded. In other words, we were coding for nothing or ourselves because we couldn't merge our code, or even get one another's. As you can imagine this made it SUPER HARD because we split the assignment into tasks. I was focused on creating the map and when I completed it, Shelly could not get my code or my scenes no matter how hard she tried. This meant that my map was pestilently lost and did not make it into the final product. For some of my other codes and her's we had to manually give each other the code through Discord so that we could copy and paste it onto our sides. This came with a lot of problems as you can imagine but eventually we found a point where we had the MVP and some beyond MVP done.</li>
                <li>Learning goDot was very difficult especially when you were trying to do 3D. There were so many components on the Godot engine and documentation to read that it took us so long to even understand a single portion of the tool. I probably spend hours just looking through videos and documentation just to get a tiny grasp on how to use goDot. I was learning why coding my game at the same time. There were just so many things related to goDot and other tools that I needed to use like asset stores to complete my game, that I needed to learn. Every step of the way, I was confused about what to do. For example, I didn't understand how I could resize my scenes or make it, so that the player could hit the mobs. It was so confusing and hard to learn the tool that I almost gave up but I didn't.  In the end from this experience, I started to understand how hard learning something on your own is. It isn't easy but VERY VERY difficult since you have to spend your own time to learn.</li>
                <li>Time management was another big issue in this project. We had the whole year to do it and to pace ourselves but I did not do well at it. I had my schedule done on when to do what, but I lacked the motivation to complete it. Even if I did do it on the assigned day, it would take way longer than I expected. This made me constantly change my schedule, pushing each day back until I couldn't do so anymore. Managing your time alone was already difficult but now I have to do so with a partner which made it even harder. We needed to consider each other's tasks so we could create a plan that worked for both of us. However, the main issue was my procrastination as I couldn't bring myself to work on it when I wanted or needed to. I did eventually work on it when I knew that I had to and there was no other choice. This allowed me to at least finish the project but not to the extent of what I planned. However, I'm still grateful that I eventually got myself to work.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Don't procrastinate! If you leave work till the end to do then you will be stressing and pulling all-nighters just to get it done. If you have time and you know it is due soon, work on it a week before it is due. This will allow you time to adjust and change your plan if things go wrong</li>
                <li>Learning on your own is very tough so take it slowly. I think what I did was try and learn goDot all at once which did not work out. It made me super confused every step I took. If I had taken more time to learn it slowly, I think it would have been more easy to learn the tool.</li>
                <li>Always check the tool before using it. We didn't research goDot before we chose to use it, so we didn't know that, it was bad for collaboration. If we knew, we would have chosen another tool that supported working as a team or just did our project by ourselves.</li>
            </ol>
    
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            Since this is the end of highschool for me, I want to focus on creating something that will be of use to me in the future. Instead of random games, I will try and add physical components to my future programs so that it can be useful and not just simply something I do for grade.
