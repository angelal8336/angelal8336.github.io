            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>My partner Henry, and I were asked to create our own story based on a topic that was given to us </p>
           
            
    
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>The topic we were given asked us to create a adventure where you die if you get a answer wrong, and so we did.</p>
            <p>This project is formatted as a trivia. It revolves around you being in a school, and answering questions to survive.</p>
            
           
            
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this project was to get us to practice linking, as well as our collabration skills</p>
            <p>In the future we will need to know how to collabrate with different people who are working in the same project as us</p>
            <p>This project will help us rememeber how to link, and improve our collabration skills</p>
            
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>The hardest part of this project was communicating with your partner even though it was a team of 2 (including me)</p> 
            <p>We had to tell each other when to push or pull, and what each of us needed to do </p>  
            <p>However, that was not difficult compare to resolving merge conflicts</p>
            <p>Whenever, we got a merge conflict we had to discuss which one we should keep</p>
            <p>The only reason we were able to solve this problem is because we talked it out</p>
            <p>Luckily for us, my partner and me were in the same class so it was easier to do so</p>
            
            <h2>Next time</h2>
            <p>If we had more time, we would add more files/pictures so that the adventure can be more cooler</p>
            
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Without communication, it is basically impossible to complete or do well in your project</li>
                <li>When you start linking more and more files together, it will become hard to keep track of it</li>
                <li>This project hurts my brain</li>
            </ol>
