                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>We were given time to create a website on existing and future technology on a topic we chose in order to inform our audience, and practice what we have learned. After every major event, we were tasked to write a blog about the process, and path we took to achieve our goals.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="margin2">
                <h3>Content</h3>
                <p>I made a website on technology in the restaurant industry using bootstrap, html, and css. The website contains information about existing technology, and future innovation in hopes to solve current problems, inform others and light up the ambitions. As for the blog, we wrote about challenges, process, engineering design process, and skills. The blogs will walk through my entire adventure of creating my website.

                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Before coding, I had to create a few wireframe for my website. These wireframes were layout/design that I thought of with all my context in mind. I came up with around 5-10 wireframe in which I could use. However, I stuggled to choose a wireframe, thanks to my indecisiveness. I kept questioning, and changing my mind until I gave up, and used all my wireframe as inspiration basically combining them all.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Coding the timeline for my existing techonolgy was difficult. I had to research, and watch videos on how to create one. However even with those, I still couldn't understand how to build a timeline out of css. But because the timeline was a must, I kept on learning, and after more than 5 hour I created a decent looking timeline that works.</p></li>

                <h3>Takeaway</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>My time management skills are not the greatest, as I finished my website in the "last second"</p></li>

                    <li><p>Coding a full on website is way harder than it seems. There are alot of things that goes into it.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Writing blogs were tiring, but creating my website was amazing</li>
                </ol>

            <div class="margin2">
                <h3>Next steps</h3>
                <p>Since we are at the end of the year, and the freedom project is done, my next step is to improve on my website as needed after I have learned javascript, which is next year's course.</p>
