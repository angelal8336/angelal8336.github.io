            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p> I been learning how to draw for about one year and a half now. For this project of my own, I created a drawing of a character I came up with using clip studio art. My inital goal was not to make this into a real digital art as I drew my characters within my notebook. It was more of a hobby since I was interested in learning how exactly anime creators drew. It started as a simple doodle until I really liked a design I came up with, and was thinking of trying digital art for a while now, so I gave it a go. In fact this is my first time drawing online, and learning how to use the application was a difficult by itself.</p>
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>When I decided to transport my notebook drawing onto the computer, I had to learn how clip studio art worked. It wasn't easy per say but I watched tutorial videos, while testing out all the speical features avaiavble for use. Eventually, I got the hang of it after a day of just drawing randomly to get use to the tools. To simplify my process, I went through 4 steps. The first step was to draw the outline of the character using the brush tool. The second was the color my character with a base color of my choosing. The third step was to layer shadows onto the base color using the layer property of clip studio. Lastly, It was to design the background of the drawing to make it fill more full</p>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>The main challenge was getting use to drawing using a digital device. Since it was my first time trying it out, it was difficult to nagativate through the application. There were many tools to learn, many features to use, and it was overwhelming. It took quite a way from my personal time to actually get the hang of clip studio. However, once I got the bare bones down, It was much more easier to complete.</p>
            <h2>Takeaways</h2></h2>
            <p>I'm not the best artist out there and that's a fact. I'm still learning to grow but finishing this project of my was a huge step up. I feel like doing this really enhanced my knowledge of art. What started as a hobby became more of a goal. Now coming out of this project, I can gladly say that my art has become better since the first time I started.</p>
