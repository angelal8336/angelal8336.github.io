                <p>
                    This year we learned how to use javascript to make interactivable codes, and p5js to make art. We also learned a javascript libaray and tool to help create our year long project on something we are passonable about. This year long project was a way to show our peers in class and during the expo on how we learned our tool, and what we decided to make. This year, me and my partner Ada decided to create a game using kaboomJs, and Earsketch. The goal was to create something that tested out our reflect, and reduced our stressed. The game we ended up creating was called dodgers. The goal of the game was to collect as much coin as possible while dodging the monster falling from the sky. Whenever you collect a coin, there would be a sound that play, and the score board will increase by 1. If you touch the monster, you lose, and the sound of game over will play. In addition to creating our game, we also wrote about challenges, and takeaways in our blog in which you could review by clicking the link on the bottom page. Now, try to get the highest score possible. Ps: our highest score was 12.

                <ol>
                    <li><p>Before coding, I had to create a few wireframe for my website. These wireframes were layout/design that I thought of with all my context in mind. I came up with around 5-10 wireframe in which I could use. However, I stuggled to choose a wireframe, thanks to my indecisiveness. I kept questioning, and changing my mind until I gave up, and used all my wireframe as inspiration basically combining them all.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Coding the timeline for my existing techonolgy was difficult. I had to research, and watch videos on how to create one. However even with those, I still couldn't understand how to build a timeline out of css. But because the timeline was a must, I kept on learning, and after more than 5 hour I created a decent looking timeline that works.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Coding a full on website is way harder than it seems. There are alot of things that goes into it.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Writing blogs were tiring, but creating my website was amazing</li>
