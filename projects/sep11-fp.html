                <p>
                    This year we learned how to use javascript to make interactivable codes, and p5js to make art. We also learned a javascript libaray and tool to help create our year long project on something we are passonable about. This year long project was a way to show our peers in class and during the expo on how we learned our tool, and what we decided to make. This year, me and my partner Ada decided to create a game using kaboomJs, and Earsketch. The goal was to create something that tested out our reflect, and reduced our stressed. The game we ended up creating was called dodgers. The goal of the game was to collect as much coin as possible while dodging the monster falling from the sky. Whenever you collect a coin, there would be a sound that play, and the score board will increase by 1. If you touch the monster, you lose, and the sound of game over will play. In addition to creating our game, we also wrote about challenges, and takeaways in our blog in which you could review by clicking the link on the bottom page. Now, try to get the highest score possible. Ps: our highest score was 12.

                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>During the whole year, I encountered many challenges along the way from coding, to writing blogs and writeup. Some challenges I faced are shown below:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Learning KaboomJs was difficult and challenging. The documentation was hard to understand since there were not many examples. They only stated what each conpoment did using one line of sentence, but no example were shown on how it should be used. This not only made it hard learn the tool, but it also made my motatvition drop because I wasn't as excited to learn KaboomJs. To help with this issue, I went on youtube and watched many hours of videos where the youtuber would show how to create a certain game like flaper birds using this tool. This made it so much easier since I was able to see the conpoment used in different situtions such as storing in an variable, which allowed me to understand how I could use it to make Dodgers. Not to mention, the github page was very useless as there were not many explanation on what is going on. The other thing that was very helpful was the kaboom discord server since there many people on there who were ready to help you with any problems on your code.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Coding the monster to spawn from the y=0 was very hard. I had to figure out a way to run the loop forever, while making it spawn randomly on the y axis while keeping the x the same. To make it spawn randomly, all I did was used width(), vec2(), and the rand() functions from kaboomJs. This allowed it to spawn randomly from the position 0, and a random number between my width of my canva. However the problem I faced was how to run it forever. I tried to code it many times myself, but I couldnt figure it out, so I asked Mr.Mueller for help, and googled the question. From here, I learned that I was able to call a function within a function without using a loop, so that was exactly how I loop my function forever. </p></li>
                </ol>

            <div class="margin2">
                <h3>Takeaway</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Watching youtube videos on certain topics is useful since it explains the topic while showing explains.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Always ask for help after you have given the challenge a go. By trying before asking, you are able to learn and process the code, which helps you understand what you did after it gets explain to yo</p></li>

                    <li><p> The freedom project was hard since we had to learn on our own. However, the end result and what we make, makes everything fun and worth. </p></p></li>

            <div class="margin2">
                <h3>Next steps</h3>
                <p>Since the freedom project is done, my next step is to add more effects, and ideas to my game in order to make it more funnier and harder. In addition, I want to improve, and revise my code because I was given a lot of feedback from my class. In addition, my next step is to go into APCSA.</p>
